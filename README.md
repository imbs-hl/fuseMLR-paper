## Simulation

To reproduce the simulation study results, perform the following steps.

Each script works on its own and just needs to load `init.R` at the start, which
loads all necessary packages and functions and defines paths.

It is recommended to clear the workspace before running each script to avoid 
conflicts between objects.

The analysis proceeds as follows: First, multi-omics data are simulated. Then,
the data are prepared depending on the integration strategyâ€”either late integration
(fuseMLR) or early integration (blockForest). Finally, various prediction modells
are trained and evaluated.

Steps:

`init.R`- Loads all required libraries, defines file paths, and sources functions. This file must be sourced at the beginning of each script.

`01_simulate_data.R` - Simulates various scenarios and stores the output in data/InterSIM/.

`02_1_prepare_sim_data.R` - Prepares the simulated data for late integration (used by fuseMLR) and saves it in data/InterSIM_split/.

`02_2_prepare_sim_data_early.R` - Prepares the simulated data for early integration (used by blockForest) and saves it in data/InterSIM_split_early/.

`03_1_create_pred_wmean.R` - Trains prediction model using the weighted mean meta-learner.

`03_2_create_perform_wmean.R` - Evaluates the performance of the weighted mean meta-learner.

`04_1_create_pred_mean.R` - Trains prediction model using the simple mean meta-learner.

`04_2_create_perform_mean.R` - Evaluates the performance of the simple mean meta-learner.

`05_1_create_pred_best.R` - Trains prediction model using the best modality selection meta-learner.

`05_2_create_perform_best.R` - Evaluates the performance of the best modality selection meta-learner.

`06_1_create_pred_cobra.R` - Trains prediction model using the COBRA meta-learner.

`06_2_create_perform_cobra.R` - Evaluates the performance of COBRA meta-learner.

`07_1_create_pred_rf.R` - Trains prediction model using random forest meta-learner (late integration).

`07_2_create_perform_rf.R` - Evaluates the performance of random forest meta-learner (late integration).

`08_1_create_pred_lasso.R` - Trains prediction model using Lasso meta-learner.

`08_2_create_perform_lasso.R` - Evaluates the performance of Lasso meta-learner.

`09_1_create_pred_blockForest_early.R` - Trains prediction model using blockForest for early integration.

`09_2_create_perform_blockForest_early.R` - Evaluates the performance of blockForest for early integration.

`10_1_create_pred_rf_early.R` - Trains prediction model using random forest for early integration.

`10_2_create_perform_rf_early.R` - Evaluates the performance of random forest for early integration.

`11_create_plots.R` - Generates plots for visualization of the results. Stores the output in img.

## Case study
To reproduce the case study results, perform the following steps.

1 - Ensure the required packages are installed and load them from `init-global.R`. Also, set up necessary paths.

2 - Use `down_data.R` to download data.

3 - Use `analysis.R` to perform the late integration prediction modeling.

4 - Use `sex-chr-check.R` to get the number of markers sampled from the X and Y chromosomes for each data-modality.
